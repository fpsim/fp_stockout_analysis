# fp_stockout_analysis
Analysis of the impact of contraceptive stockouts on mCPR and FP outcomes. WIP!

Instructions:
1. Install `fpsim` by cloning the FPsim repository (https://github.com/fpsim/fpsim). Once you have cloned the `fpsim` repository, check out the branch `plot-options`, which contains some changes to plotting that this repo relies upon. Once you've cloned and checked out that branch, run `pip install -e .` (including the final dot!) from within the fpsim folder.
2. Run the file `run_senegal.py` within this repo to create a model for Senegal, run it, and compare it to data.
